# "Split" - Interactive quad bisection painting sketch with p5.js

This is an interactive p5.js sketch for the [#WCCChallenge](https://openprocessing.org/curation/78544) Nov'25 themed "split". In it, the user can play around bisecting / inflating / shrinking quads to various depths with mouse and keyboard.

Written in typescript and p5 v2.x in global-mode with modules, partly to test v2 typescript types and global mode setup. (Bundled with vite)

## Credits

I've written similar sketches years ago (studying Okazz, mostly) but did this one without consulting/reusing any code.

-   Original quad bisection inspiration and education from [Okazz's sketch "201216a"](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1045334/)
-   Some palette(s) from [kgolid's chromotome](https://github.com/kgolid/chromotome) via [https://nice-colours-quicker.netlify.app/](nice-colours-quicker)

## other studies around this idea

-   Okazz original (to my knowledge): https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1045334/
-   from 2023 a minimal featured and hopefully clearer re-write, recursive as per original. https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1970161
-   from 2021 https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1303469 somewhat interactive reveal with optional insetting
